## EthPM
The course suggested incorporating EthPM, and this project imports the [jsmnsol-lib](https://www.ethpm.com/registry/packages/26) package from EthPM.

## Oraclize
The course suggested incorporating an oracle, and this project utilizes [Oraclize](http://www.oraclize.it/).

## TESTING
Since the 2018 NFL season has not begun, the best way to test this end to end is to wager on a game from last season that has already completed.  There is a hardcoded game which you can test with, which will allow you to wager on both teams, and then verify the result with the oracle, which will then trigger paying out the winner.

To test that, visit this [link](https://ebaizel.github.io/Winning/#/tournament?home=DET&away=GB&date=2017-12-31)
